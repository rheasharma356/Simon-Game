# Simon-Game

 

 To begin, we present a start screen to the player. They initiate the game by clicking on the start button. The game then illuminates colours in a specific sequence. The player's task is to memorize the sequence and click the colours in the exact same order.
If the player successfully matches the sequence, they progress to the next level, where the sequence length increases by 1. However, if the player fails to reproduce the correct sequence, they lose the game. At that point, we display their score, represented by the count of successfully completed sequences, and present a 'Play Again' button for another attempt.
